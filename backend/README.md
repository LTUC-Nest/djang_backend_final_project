In Django, when using the `rest_framework_simplejwt` library for JWT authentication, you can customize the token payload to include any additional claims that are relevant to your application's needs. 

The claims you can access and include in the token payload depend on the attributes available on the `User` model or any other related models. Here is a list of common claims you might consider adding to your JWT token payload:

### Common User Model Claims

These claims can be accessed directly from Django's built-in `User` model (`django.contrib.auth.models.User`):

1. **`user_id`**: The primary key (ID) of the user.
2. **`username`**: The username of the user.
3. **`email`**: The email address of the user.
4. **`is_active`**: A boolean indicating whether the user's account is active.
5. **`is_superuser`**: A boolean indicating whether the user is a superuser (admin).
6. **`is_staff`**: A boolean indicating whether the user has staff status (non-admin but can access the admin interface).
7. **`date_joined`**: The date and time when the user account was created.
8. **`last_login`**: The date and time when the user last logged in.

### Other Potential Custom Claims

If your application uses a custom user model or extends the default user model with additional fields, you can include any of those custom fields as claims in your JWT. Here are some examples of other claims you might include based on additional user attributes:

1. **`first_name`**: The user's first name (if applicable).
2. **`last_name`**: The user's last name (if applicable).
3. **`full_name`**: A custom field or a concatenation of `first_name` and `last_name`.
4. **`profile_image`**: A URL or path to the user's profile image.
5. **`role`**: A custom role attribute if your user model has one (e.g., "admin", "editor", "viewer").
6. **`permissions`**: A list or set of specific permissions assigned to the user.
7. **`groups`**: A list of groups the user belongs to (if you use Django's built-in group model).
8. **`phone_number`**: The user's phone number, if stored.
9. **`address`**: The user's address, if applicable.
10. **`timezone`**: The user's timezone setting.
11. **`language`**: The preferred language of the user.

### Adding Custom Claims to JWT

To add any of these claims to your JWT, you will modify the `get_token` method of your custom serializer as shown in the previous response.

Here is an example that adds more custom claims to the JWT payload:

```python
from rest_framework_simplejwt.serializers import TokenObtainPairSerializer

class CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer(TokenObtainPairSerializer):
    @classmethod
    def get_token(cls, user):
        # Get the original token
        token = super().get_token(user)

        # Add custom claims
        token['user_id'] = user.id
        token['username'] = user.username
        token['email'] = user.email
        token['is_superuser'] = user.is_superuser
        token['is_staff'] = user.is_staff
        token['first_name'] = user.first_name
        token['last_name'] = user.last_name
        token['date_joined'] = user.date_joined.isoformat()  # Include the date joined
        token['last_login'] = user.last_login.isoformat() if user.last_login else None
        
        # Add any other custom fields or logic you need
        # Example: token['role'] = user.role  # If you have a custom role field

        return token
```

### Conclusion

You can include any fields available on the `User` model or any other related models in your JWT payload as custom claims. The choice of what to include should be guided by your application's security requirements and what information needs to be available client-side. Just ensure that you do not expose sensitive or unnecessary information in the token payload, as JWTs can be decoded by anyone with access to them.
